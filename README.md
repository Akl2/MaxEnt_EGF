Based on an [established framework:  Maximum Entropy Framework for Predictive Inference of Cell Population Heterogeneity and Responses in Signaling Networks, Cell Systems 10, 204 (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31864963/) and expanding it to work with stochastic signaling networks. This repo contains code developed for two signaling networks 

1- EGF - EGFR 

2- IGF - FOXO
